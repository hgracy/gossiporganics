				<ul class="facts">
					<li>Although the term “lipstick” wasn’t first used until 1880, lipstick use dates back to Ancient Egypt. It’s said that Cleopatra made her red lipstick from crushed Carmine beetles and ants.</li>
					<br>
					<li> At one point in time, it was acceptable to apply lipstick in public during lunch, but never at dinner! </li>
					<br>
					<li>Ever watch a 1920s silent film and wonder why the actresses wore black lipstick? That’s because film stock was sensitive to color and red lipstick would register as black! </li>
					<br>
					<li>White lipstick (and matte!) was a trend in the 1960s for a true “mod” look. </li>
					<br>
					<li>Some shimmery lipsticks contained fish scales (also known as “pearl essence”) for shine.</li>
					<br>
					<li>It’s said that women who wear lipstick daily (even on sick days!) unintentionally eat about 4 pounds of lipstick in their lifetime. We're looking at you, lipstick lovers!</li>
					<br>
					<li>According to a study called the “Lipstick Effect” women increase their desire to buy lipstick during economic recessions because of the decreasing number in quality mates.</li>
					<br>
					<li> Lipstick sales also tend to go up on gloomy or rainy days! But can you blame us?</li>
					<br>
					<li> In the 1700s, a man could have his marriage annulled if his wife had used lip rouge during their courtship. Oh, the horror!</li>
					<br>
					<li> Over 80 percent of American women wear lipstick — that’s more than the French!</li>
